# Profile photo (Chrome + all browsers)

HEIC does not display in Chrome. To show your photo everywhere:

1. Convert `logos/Sneha.HEIC` to JPG (e.g. open in Preview → File → Export → JPEG).
2. Save the JPEG as **`photo.jpg`** in this folder (`public/`).
3. The site uses `imageUrl: "/photo.jpg"` and will show it in all browsers.
