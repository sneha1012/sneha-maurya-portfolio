# Logos for Education & Experience

**Add your logo files in this folder.**  
Full path: `portfolio-website/public/logos/`

The site will show them all at the **same size** next to each Education and Experience row. You can use any dimensions; they’re resized to fit.

## File names (use these exactly)

| File name | Where it appears |
|-----------|------------------|
| `columbia.png` | Columbia University (Education) |
| `srm.png` | SRM University (Education) |
| `ibm.png` | IBM (Experience) |
| `nxp.png` | NXP Semiconductors (Experience) |
| `columbia-business-school.png` | Columbia Business School (Experience) |
| `metropolis.png` | Metropolis Healthcare (Experience) |

Formats: `.png`, `.svg`, or `.webp` (e.g. `ibm.svg` is fine; the data files use `.png` but you can change the extension in `src/data/experience.ts` and `src/data/education.ts` if needed).
